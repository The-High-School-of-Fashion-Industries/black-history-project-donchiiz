    <h2>Mirror!</h2>
    Janet Emerson Bashen is a Mirror to me, I aspire to be somebody who can make a change the way she did by supporting what she believed in. To me, I take pride in my opinions and values with what I feel is right. The way she accomplished this took a lot of effort as well as pushing so hard for what she believed in. I dream to do something like that.  <img src="assets/jeb2.jpg" alt="Janet E Bashen image relaxed" width=200px id="img2"></main>
